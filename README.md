==============================================================================

Thumbor engine for the OpenCV imaging library.

This engine used to be built-in in thumbor, but from now on this is where it will be maintained. For more informations on development check the contributing section.

Installing
==========

Just pip install it:

    $ pip install opencv-engine

In order to use this engine with your thumbor install, specify this engine as the imaging engine:

    # imaging engine to use to process images
    ENGINE = 'opencv_engine'

Instead of the value you used before of 'thumbor.engines.opencv'.
